## About

### General

This is DHAMUN Dev.

I'm going to explain what I'm trying to do here, both in technical and non technical terms. Read on.

#### Non-Programmers

DHAMUN is an outstanding conference. It truly is. 
But it's limited. Imagine.

```
Imagine meetings where you didn't take attendance by running 
around with a spreadsheet. People take out there phones and 
mark themselves present, using a geolocation sensor in there phone.

Imagine realtime tracking for resolution votes. 
No need to "tally the house or whatever." 

Imagine submitting a resolution online, and not carrying a USB around.

Imagine DHAMUN virtualized. Let's make this imagination a reality.
```

Now that was nice. The point of this project is to create an ecosystem for DHAMUN, not a simple, pretty website. I've created a client you can check out in another repo. This is the start.

This is DHAMUN Dev. 

```
a) A web client (started)
b) A server (coming soon)
c) A mobile app (coming soon)
```
