## About

### General

This is DHAMUN Dev.

I'm going to explain what I'm trying to do here, both in technical and non technical terms. Read on.

#### Non-Programmers

DHAMUN is an outstanding conference. It truly is. 
But it's limited. Imagine.

```
Imagine meetings where you didn't take attendance by running 
around with a spreadsheet. People take out there phones and 
mark themselves present, using a geolocation sensor in there phone.

Imagine realtime tracking for resolution votes. 
No need to "tally the house or whatever." 

Imagine submitting a resolution online, and not carrying a USB around.

Imagine DHAMUN virtualized. Let's make this imagination a reality.
```

Now that was nice. The point of this project is to create an ecosystem for DHAMUN, not a simple, pretty website. I've created a client you can check out in another repo. This is the start.

This is DHAMUN Dev. 

```
a) A web client (started)
b) A server (coming soon)
c) A mobile app (coming soon)
```

### Programmers

Read the non-programmers section. Then come back here.

The web client is built on React, and follows Flux patterns using somthing called Redux. It's an alternative to MVC app structures.

It has hotloading, uses React-Router (I can hear you cackling with joy), and has tests. (Not so many now :p)

The server will run on Node.js, and will use MongoDB as a database.

The app will use React Native. 

### Contributing

Open an issue on github. Make a PR that fixes it (if you want).
